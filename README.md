This is a challenge trophy games set me up to do. I read the information they sent me and wrote the key points in my notes.

When I wrote this, I figgery out that I was only allowed to use 7 hours.
I have a bit more, closer to 10 / 11 hours.

### One of the nice things I learned.
That must be how to use **leaflet** and **jquery.ajax**

### How to run the game.
You need to clone the project and write this in a terminal.
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/taxidriver2192/trophy.git
```

**After that, you need to go to the folder.**
``` bash
cd trophy
```

**Install npm package**
```npm
npm install
```

**Set up the database.**

There is a file called `leaderboard.gz`. Use that.
